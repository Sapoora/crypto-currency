This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the history, technology, and future of blockchain and digital currencies, blending historical context with technical depth. Students begin by tracing the evolution of digital currencies from DigiCash and B-money to Bitcoin, delving into the roles of Cypherpunks and Satoshi Nakamoto. Core cryptographic concepts like public-key cryptography, digital signatures, and hash functions are introduced, leading to an in-depth study of Bitcoin's decentralized network, blockchain mechanics, and mining protocols, including their vulnerabilities. The curriculum progresses to advanced topics such as alternative consensus mechanisms, scaling challenges, game theory applications, and anonymity solutions like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Zcash. It concludes with smart contracts and Ethereum, equipping learners with a holistic understanding of the blockchain ecosystem.
